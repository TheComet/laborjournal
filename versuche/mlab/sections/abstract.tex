System identification is an important topic in control theory. Small  errors  in
the derivation of a  real  world  system's  transfer  function can lead to large
deviations  later  on. Worse, it can lead  to  unstable  control  loops.  It  is
therefore crucial to create an accurate model.

In this report, two system  identification techniques proposed by L. Sani and P.
Hudzovic will be analysed and compared to one another. It will be  shown  that a
combination of L. Sani's characterisation and P.  Hudzovic's  transfer  function
formula produces the most  accurate  results.  Furthermore, an extension to both
methods will be proposed using a least square fit, allowing the obtained  system
to be further refined.
