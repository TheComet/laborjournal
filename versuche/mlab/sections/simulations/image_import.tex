\subsection{Reading curves from images}

More often than not we are required to measure $T_u$  and  $T_g$  by  hand  from
visual plots, without access to the underlying data. To  overcome  the  need  to
print out the plots onto paper and measure  the  data  by hand, an algorithm for
extracting this data from an image was developed.

The algorithm is quite simple: The image data is imported into HSV colour space.
In  the majority of cases, the grid and background will be white, black or  some
grey-scale. The data on the other hand will have a specific colour, which allows
us to first detect  what  the  colour is and then filter the image by hue to get
all data points that have a similar colour.

If the plot happens to be black and white with no colour, then it is possible to
filter  the  data  using  the   ``value''   component   from   the   HSV   data.

The resulting data is usually noisy, but statistically evenly distributed, which
makes  decimation  very easy: Just select every nth data point.  The  data  from
\ref{fig:image:scatter_raw} was decimated by a factor of 50, resulting in figure
\ref{fig:image:scatter_dec}.
