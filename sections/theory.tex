\section{Theory}

The effect of any invariant linear system (LTI) on an arbitrary input  signal is
obtained by convolution of the input signal  with  the system's impulse response
function. In a LTI system, the  output  of the system $y(t)$ for an input $x(t)$
can be obtained by the convolution integral:

\begin{equation}
    y(t)=g(t)*x(t)=\int_0^t g(t-\tau)x(\tau)\,d\tau
\end{equation}

where $g(t)$ is the \textit{impulse response}  of the system. That is, $g(t)$ is
the output of the system with an input $x(t)$ = $\delta(t)$,  where  $\delta(t)$
is the Dirac delta. The impulse response completely  characterizes  the  dynamic
behavior of the system

Ideally, one would want to directly measure the impulse response. Unfortunately,
it is very hard to do this in most practical cases, due to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Difficulty of generating a Dirac delta function (infinite amplitude, zero time).
    \item Any finite approximation of the Dirac delta function will cause an extremely small and hard to measure response signal.
\end{enumerate}

A far more practical method is  to  measure  the \textit{step response} instead.
The derivative of the resulting measured signal will  very  closely resemble its
theoretical impulse resopnse.
