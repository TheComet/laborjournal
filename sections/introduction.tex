\section{Introduction}

There  are  many  ways  to  measure  and  identify a system and there  are  many
different  systems  to  be measured. In this report we will confine ourselves to
linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems only. Additionally,  we  will  also confine
ourselves to systems with no overshoot or undershoot.

The two most common methods are elaborated in  detail. Furthermore, an extension
to both methods involving a least squares fit will be proposed.
